## During the course of this project phase, I was assigned the following tasks :

  -Brainstorm on ideas https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-100_AnimaLib/issues/16

  -Design several wireframe for the user profile pages https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-100_AnimaLib/issues/26 

  -Design several low fidelity for the user profile pages Design several pages for User profile in low fidelity  https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-100_AnimaLib/issues/39

  -Produce high fidelity designs of the user profile pages Design several pages for User profile in high fidelity  https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-100_AnimaLib/issues/40

## Solutions to the tasks I was assigned to :

  -During the brainstorming session, I drew a [Rough user flow sletch](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=3593%3A19426) which was a guide in designing the [User flow](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2712%3A63197)

  -Designed wireframes for the User profile section. This section consists of the following pages : Profile Dropdown [Profile dropdown](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2882%3A25008) , [Profile page](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2882%3A25098) , [View profile page](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2882%3A25041) , [Edit profile page](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2882%3A25176) , [Edit Profile (Expanded)](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2882%3A25208) and [My saves page](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=2882%3A25238)

  -Went ahead to turn all the pages created in the wireframe to [Low Fidelity Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=3585%3A19428)

  -Then designed the [High fidelity designs](https://www.figma.com/file/VLaolzmNxT8lx7uBMsYVMz/Team-100_AnimaLib?node-id=3585%3A19426).
